Powerline Shell is a beautiful and useful prompt generator for Bash, ZSH, Fish, and tcsh:

- Shows some important details about the git/svn/hg/fossil branch  
- Changes color if the last command exited with a failure code  
- If you're too deep into a directory tree, shortens the displayed path with an ellipsis  
- Shows the current Python virtualenv environment  
- It's easy to customize and extend. See below for   
- The generated prompts are designed to resemble powerline, but otherwise this project has no relation to powerline. 

**Note: This will only work with lxterminal and xfce4-terminal. If you want this script to work for other terminals please open a issue.**
